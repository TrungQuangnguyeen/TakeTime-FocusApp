# IMMEDIATE TESTING CHECKLIST FOR OVERLAY BLOCKING

## ‚úÖ QUICK VERIFICATION STEPS

### 1. APP STATUS CHECK
- [x] App is installed on device
- [x] AppBlockingService is running (logs show "Method 1 - Currently running app")
- [ ] Accessibility Service enabled
- [ ] System Alert Window permission granted

### 2. IMMEDIATE MANUAL TEST

#### Setup (2 minutes):
1. Open TakeTime app on your device
2. Go to "·ª®ng d·ª•ng b·ªã ch·∫∑n" (Blocked Apps)
3. Add any app you have installed (e.g., Chrome, Facebook, Calculator)
4. Set time limit to 1 minute
5. Check the toggle to enable blocking

#### Trigger Test:
1. Use the test app for more than 1 minute
2. Close the app completely
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Try to reopen the blocked app

#### Expected Result:
```
‚úÖ App starts to open
‚úÖ Immediately, overlay covers entire screen
‚úÖ Shows message: "·ª®ng d·ª•ng n√†y ƒë√£ ƒë∆∞·ª£c s·ª≠ d·ª•ng v∆∞·ª£t qu√° th·ªùi gian cho ph√©p trong h√¥m nay, h√£y t·∫≠p trung l√†m vi·ªác kh√°c nh√©!"
‚úÖ Red button shows "Tho√°t ·ª©ng d·ª•ng"
‚úÖ Tapping button closes app and returns to home
```

### 3. PERMISSION VERIFICATION

#### Check Accessibility Service:
1. Settings ‚Üí Accessibility
2. Find "TakeTime" or "Smart Management App"
3. Make sure it's enabled

#### Check Display Over Apps:
1. Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí TakeTime
2. Permissions ‚Üí Display over other apps
3. Make sure it's allowed

#### Check Usage Access:
1. Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Special access
2. Usage access ‚Üí TakeTime
3. Make sure it's enabled

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### If overlay doesn't appear:
1. Check "Display over other apps" permission
2. Restart TakeTime app
3. Re-enable Accessibility Service

### If app isn't detected as blocked:
1. Verify app is in blocked list with toggle ON
2. Check time limit is exceeded
3. Restart AppBlockingService (disable/enable accessibility)

### If overlay appears but app still accessible:
1. This is actually expected - overlay should completely cover app
2. Make sure you can't interact with app underneath
3. The overlay should prevent all access to blocked app

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

The overlay blocking system is working if:
- ‚úÖ Blocked apps can be opened initially
- ‚úÖ Overlay immediately covers the entire app screen
- ‚úÖ User cannot interact with app underneath overlay
- ‚úÖ Clear Vietnamese message explains the situation
- ‚úÖ Exit button successfully closes the app
- ‚úÖ User returns to home screen after exiting

## üìû NEXT STEPS

After successful testing:
1. Test with multiple different apps
2. Test with different time limits
3. Test edge cases (quick app switching, back button, etc.)
4. Verify performance impact is minimal

The new overlay approach should be much more user-friendly than the previous force-close method while being harder to bypass.
