## üß™ TESTING SCENARIOS

### Test 1: SAFETY VERIFICATION (Critical)
**Objective**: Confirm app cannot block itself

**Steps**:
1. Open TakeTime Focus App
2. Navigate to "Blocked Apps" screen
3. Look through the entire app list
4. Search for "TakeTime", "Smart Management", or "Qu·∫£n l√Ω"

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ TakeTime app should NOT appear in selectable apps list
- ‚úÖ Search should return no results for TakeTime
- ‚úÖ If somehow accessible, tapping should show Vietnamese warning message

**Critical**: If TakeTime appears in the list or can be selected, DO NOT TAP IT. Report immediately.

### Test 2: NORMAL FUNCTIONALITY (Essential)
**Objective**: Verify regular app blocking works correctly

**Setup**:
1. Add Facebook, Instagram, or any social media app to blocked list
2. Start a 5-minute focus session
3. Try to open the blocked app

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Blocked app should show blocking overlay
- ‚úÖ User should be redirected back to TakeTime
- ‚úÖ TakeTime should remain fully accessible
- ‚úÖ Focus session should continue normally

### Test 3: STRESS TESTING (Recommended)
**Objective**: Test app under various conditions

**Scenarios**:
1. **Multiple Apps**: Block 5-10 different apps simultaneously
2. **Long Sessions**: Run 30+ minute focus sessions
3. **System Apps**: Try to add system apps (should handle gracefully)
4. **Rapid Switching**: Quickly switch between apps during focus session

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ All blocked apps should be blocked consistently
- ‚úÖ TakeTime remains responsive and accessible
- ‚úÖ No crashes or unexpected behaviors
- ‚úÖ Battery usage remains reasonable
