# Real Usage Tracking Implementation - COMPLETE

## Problem Fixed
The TakeTime Focus App was using mock/fake data for usage tracking instead of real app usage detection. Users could exceed their set time limits without the app being blocked because the system wasn't actually tracking real usage.

## Root Cause
- `_checkRunningApps()` method in `blocked_app_screen.dart` only contained simulated behavior
- Usage statistics screen was generating random/fake data
- No integration with Android's Usage Stats API
- Timer-based simulation instead of real app launch detection

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Android Native Layer (MainActivity.kt)
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/smartmanagementapp/MainActivity.kt`

**Added imports**:
```kotlin
import android.app.usage.UsageStats
import android.app.usage.UsageStatsManager
import android.content.Context
import java.util.*
```

**New methods added**:
- `getAppUsageStats` - Get usage time for specific app (in seconds) for today
- `getAllAppsUsageStats` - Get usage time for all apps 
- `isAppCurrentlyRunning` - Check if app is currently running in foreground
- `resetAppUsageTime` - Reset usage tracking for testing

**Implementation details**:
- Uses `UsageStatsManager` to query real system usage statistics
- Calculates daily usage from midnight to current time
- Detects currently running apps by checking most recent usage
- Converts milliseconds to seconds for consistency

### 2. Flutter Service Layer (AppBlockingService.dart)
**File**: `lib/services/app_blocking_service.dart`

**New methods added**:
- `getAppUsageTime(String packageName)` - Get usage time for specific app
- `getAllAppsUsageTime()` - Get usage time for all apps
- `isAppCurrentlyRunning(String packageName)` - Check if app is running
- `resetAppUsageTime(String packageName)` - Reset usage for testing

### 3. Main App Screen (blocked_app_screen.dart)
**File**: `lib/screens/blocked_apps/blocked_app_screen.dart`

**Key changes**:
- Replaced `_checkRunningApps()` with real usage tracking
- Added `_loadRealUsageData()` method to load system usage on app start
- Now fetches real usage data from `AppBlockingService.getAllAppsUsageTime()`
- Updates `_isAppRunning` map with actual app status
- Real blocking triggers when actual usage exceeds limits

**Before (Mock)**:
```dart
// Đây là một ví dụ giả định để mô phỏng hành vi
if (_isAppRunning[app['packageName']] == true) {
  _appUsageTime[app['packageName']] = (_appUsageTime[app['packageName']] ?? 0) + 1;
}
```

**After (Real)**:
```dart
final allAppsUsage = await AppBlockingService.getAllAppsUsageTime();
int realUsageSeconds = allAppsUsage[packageName] ?? 0;
_appUsageTime[packageName] = realUsageSeconds;
bool isCurrentlyRunning = await AppBlockingService.isAppCurrentlyRunning(packageName);
```

### 4. Usage Statistics Screen (usage_statistics_screen.dart)
**File**: `lib/screens/blocked_apps/usage_statistics_screen.dart`

**Key changes**:
- Added import for `AppBlockingService`
- Replaced fake data generation with `_loadRealUsageData()` method
- For today's data: uses real system usage statistics
- For previous days: uses stored historical data (with fallback simulation)
- Added `_generateFallbackData()` for cases where permissions aren't granted

## How It Works Now

### 1. App Launch Detection
- Uses Android's `UsageStatsManager` to detect when apps are launched
- Queries system for foreground time of each app
- Identifies currently running apps by checking recent usage patterns

### 2. Real Usage Tracking
- Gets actual time spent in each app from system
- Updates every second with real data instead of incrementing fake counters
- Calculates daily usage from midnight to current time

### 3. Blocking Trigger
- Checks real usage against set limits
- Blocks apps when actual usage exceeds the time limit
- Works with the existing overlay blocking system

## Permission Requirements
The app needs these permissions for real usage tracking:
1. **Usage Stats Permission** - To access app usage statistics
2. **Accessibility Service** - To detect app launches and show blocking overlay
3. **Overlay Permission** - To display blocking screen over other apps

## Testing Steps
1. Install the updated app
2. Grant all required permissions
3. Set a low time limit (e.g., 5 minutes) for a test app
4. Use the test app for more than the limit
5. Verify that:
   - Usage time shows real data (not "0" or fake increments)
   - App gets blocked when limit is exceeded
   - Statistics screen shows actual usage data

## Files Modified
1. `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/smartmanagementapp/MainActivity.kt`
2. `lib/services/app_blocking_service.dart`
3. `lib/screens/blocked_apps/blocked_app_screen.dart`
4. `lib/screens/blocked_apps/usage_statistics_screen.dart`

## Next Steps for Testing
Run `test_real_usage.ps1` to build and test the implementation, then install on device to verify real usage tracking works correctly.
