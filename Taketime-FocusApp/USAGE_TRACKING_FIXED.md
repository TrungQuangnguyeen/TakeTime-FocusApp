# ✅ USAGE TRACKING FIXED - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Your TakeTime Focus App's blocking system was not working because it was using **fake/mock data** instead of real app usage tracking. The app would show "not used" even after exceeding time limits because it wasn't connected to Android's actual usage statistics.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### ❌ Before (Broken)
```dart
// Mock behavior - not real tracking
// Đây là một ví dụ giả định để mô phỏng hành vi
for (var app in _blockedApps) {
  if (_isAppRunning[app['packageName']] == true) {
    // Fake increment - not real usage
    _appUsageTime[app['packageName']] = (_appUsageTime[app['packageName']] ?? 0) + 1;
  }
}
```

### ✅ After (Fixed)
```dart
// Real usage tracking using Android Usage Stats API
final allAppsUsage = await AppBlockingService.getAllAppsUsageTime();
for (var app in _blockedApps) {
  String packageName = app['packageName'];
  int realUsageSeconds = allAppsUsage[packageName] ?? 0; // Real system data
  _appUsageTime[packageName] = realUsageSeconds;
  bool isCurrentlyRunning = await AppBlockingService.isAppCurrentlyRunning(packageName);
  _isAppRunning[packageName] = isCurrentlyRunning;
}
```

## 🚀 New Features Added

### 1. Real Usage Data Collection
- **Native Android Integration**: Added UsageStatsManager to MainActivity.kt
- **Real-time Data**: Gets actual app usage from Android system
- **Daily Usage Calculation**: Tracks usage from midnight to current time
- **Currently Running Detection**: Identifies apps actively being used

### 2. Updated Methods

**MainActivity.kt (Android)**:
- `getAppUsageStats` - Get real usage time for specific app
- `getAllAppsUsageStats` - Get usage for all apps at once  
- `isAppCurrentlyRunning` - Check if app is currently active
- `resetAppUsageTime` - Reset tracking for testing

**AppBlockingService.dart (Flutter)**:
- `getAppUsageTime()` - Flutter wrapper for usage stats
- `getAllAppsUsageTime()` - Get all app usage data
- `isAppCurrentlyRunning()` - Check app running status

### 3. Fixed App Blocking Logic
- **Real Trigger**: Now blocks apps based on actual usage exceeding limits
- **Live Updates**: Usage data updates with real system statistics
- **Accurate Display**: Shows actual time spent in apps, not fake data

## 📱 How to Test

### Install & Setup
1. **Build the app**: `flutter build apk --debug`
2. **Install on device**: `flutter install` 
3. **Grant permissions**: Usage Stats + Accessibility + Overlay permissions

### Testing Steps
1. **Set a low limit**: Set 5 minutes limit for any app (Instagram, TikTok, etc.)
2. **Use the app**: Actually open and use the app for 6+ minutes
3. **Check the interface**: 
   - Usage time should show real minutes used (not "0" or fake data)
   - App should get blocked when you exceed 5 minutes
   - Statistics screen should show actual usage data

### What Should Happen Now
- ✅ **Real usage tracking**: Interface shows actual time spent in apps
- ✅ **Working blocking**: Apps get blocked when limits are exceeded  
- ✅ **Live updates**: Usage counters update with real system data
- ✅ **Accurate statistics**: Usage statistics show real historical data

## 🎉 Success Indicators

If the fix worked, you should see:
1. **Usage time increases** when you actually use apps (not fake increments)
2. **Blocking overlay appears** when you exceed set time limits
3. **Real usage data** in statistics instead of random/fake numbers
4. **"Not used" problem solved** - shows actual usage time

## 📋 Files Modified
- ✅ `MainActivity.kt` - Added real usage stats integration
- ✅ `AppBlockingService.dart` - Added usage tracking methods  
- ✅ `blocked_app_screen.dart` - Replaced mock with real tracking
- ✅ `usage_statistics_screen.dart` - Now uses real system data

Your app blocking system should now work correctly with real usage tracking! 🎯
